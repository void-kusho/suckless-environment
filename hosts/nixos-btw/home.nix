# nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate declared in ./default.nix applies here
# too. With useUserPackages the packages land in
# /etc/profiles/per-user/void and are part of the system closure: one
# `nixos-rebuild switch' applies everything, and there is no separate
# `home-manager switch' to forget.
