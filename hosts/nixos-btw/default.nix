# nixos-btw — the reference machine, complete.
#
# This is the one host in this repository that describes a real disk. Every
# parity claim in CLAUDE.md is checked against it, and it is the machine the
# whole repository was written on: Intel i5-1135G7, 16 GiB, eDP-1 + DP-1.
#
# Rebuild it from a clone, with no /etc/nixos in the loop:
#
#   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /home/void/suckless-environment#nixos-btw
#
# Three layers, as before -- only the outer one moved here from /etc/nixos:
#
#   ../../nix/laptop.nix     the desktop and the chipset
#   this file                the installation: boot, identity, user, language
#   ./home.nix               this user: their applications
#
# hardware-configuration.nix is a SNAPSHOT of what nixos-generate-config
# wrote on this machine. It holds the UUIDs of these disks and is true only
# for as long as they are not reformatted. Refresh it with:
#
#   nixos-generate-config --show-hardware-config \
#     | nixfmt > hosts/nixos-btw/hardware-configuration.nix
#
# Anyone reproducing this desktop on OTHER hardware wants
# `nix flake init -t .#laptop' instead, which writes an /etc/nixos with no
# disks in it. See README.

  # Interface language: English.
  #
  # nix/module.nix makes this desktop Japanese-first -- ja_JP.UTF-8 with
  # LANGUAGE=ja:en -- and declares both with mkDefault exactly so an
  # installation can decide otherwise. A plain assignment here outranks it.
  #
  # This is the *interface* language and nothing else. The keyboard is a
  # separate set of options and is untouched: br/abnt2 on X and br-abnt2 on
  # the TTYs, both still owned by the module. fcitx5 + mozc stay, so typing
  # Japanese is one hotkey away.
  #
  # en_US.UTF-8 is already in i18n.supportedLocales, so this generates no
  # new locale and rebuilds no glibc-locales: it changes /etc/locale.conf
  # and nothing else.
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------

  # ...and the way back, kept symmetric. The module ships
  # specialisation.english, which against the system above is now identical
  # to its own parent -- two English entries in the boot menu, one of them
  # named for the thing that no longer distinguishes it. mkForce replaces
  # the whole attribute set, so this host owns the specialisations: the
  # parent is English, and there is exactly one alternative entry.
  #
  # What mkForce costs: a specialisation added to nix/module.nix later would
  # be dropped here silently. Taken deliberately -- the module has had
  # exactly one since it was written, and it is this one, inverted.
  #
  # mkForce on the values too, and this part is not optional: the parent now
  # declares both at normal priority, and a specialisation's configuration
  # merges as just another module, so without it the definitions collide.
  #
  # Switch without rebooting, then log out and back in (a running session
  # keeps the LANG it was started with):
  #
  #   sudo /run/current-system/specialisation/japanese/bin/switch-to-configuration switch
  #
  # For a single program none of this is needed -- `LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8 emacs'
  # works as-is, because the locale is generated either way.

  # ~/.config/suckless/autostart.sh are overwritten -- change the layout
  # here instead, and apply it without rebooting with
